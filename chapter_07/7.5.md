First define the class of square

maybe likes

```c++
class Square{
    double lower_left_x;
    double lower_left_y;
    double width;
    double height;
}
```

so the middle point of square is
```c++
double x = lower_left_x + width / 2;
double y = lower_left_y + height / 2;
```

some cases:  
1. same middle point => infinite any line  
2. y of middle point are same => y = lower_left_y + height / 2;  
3. x of middle poiont are same => x = lower_left_x + width / 2;  
4. other case: y = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2)* x + c
