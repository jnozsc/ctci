every line in a Cartesian plane can be described as    
```Matlab
y = k * x + c 
```

so, we can define a class
```c++

#def max_epsilon 0.0000000001 // etc
class line{    
    double k;    
    double c;    
};
```

and how to check whether they are intersect?
```c++
bool isIntersect(line l1,line l2){
    return l1->k-l2->k>max_epsilon;
}
```
